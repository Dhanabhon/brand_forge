BrandForge is a powerful Flutter package that empowers you to dynamically change your Flutter application's name and icon directly from the command line or within your Dart code. This is incredibly useful for white-labeling, creating multiple app variants, or managing different branding strategies.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Dynamic App Name Changes:** Effortlessly modify the display name of your app for both iOS and Android platforms.
* **Custom App Icons:** Swap out your app's icon with ease, allowing for complete visual rebranding on both platforms.
* **Comprehensive Logging:** Track the changes made by BrandForge with detailed logging, including informative messages, progress indicators, success confirmations, and error reports.
* **Command-Line Interface (CLI):**  Operate BrandForge via the command line for efficient automation.
* **Programmatic API:** Integrate BrandForge directly within your Dart code for complete flexibility.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* **Flutter SDK:** Version 3.29.1 or higher.
* **Dart SDK:** Version 3.7.0 or higher.
